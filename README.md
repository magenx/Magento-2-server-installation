## üî° Environment / Magento mode:  
You can select the type of environment and Magento mode respectively. By installing 3 environments on one server at the same time - developer, staging and production, or one type only if you use simple development or even different servers per environment. The script configures users, folders, and all settings for a given environment.
  
  
## üìÑ Get config:  
All configuration parameters saved in sqlite database.
```
sqlite3 -line /opt/magenx/config/magenx.db "SELECT * FROM magento;"
sqlite3 -line /opt/magenx/config/magenx.db "SELECT * FROM system;"
```
  
## üõ°Ô∏è SSL / HTTPS:
Once up and running, set up SSL with certbot (already installed):  
`certbot certonly --agree-tos --no-eff-email --email {EMAIL} --webroot -w /home/{USER}/public_html/pub`  
and uncomment the lines for SSL in:  
- /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
- /etc/nginx/sites-available/{DOMAIN_NAME}.conf

  
## :hammer_and_wrench: DevOps idea:
You have the opportunity to install a new Magento 2, and it is best to do this in a developer environment. Push the code to your Github repository and from there develop and deploy to production and staging environment using Github Actions.  
This is the safest and most productive approach.
There are few configuration files available for Github Actions [paid extra] deployments: 
 - `/opt/deploy/deploy.py` - basic script to catch Github Actions deployment input and run zero-downtime deployment
 - `~/.env` - magento 2 environment variables
 - `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` - pre-configured ssh keys

  
### Deployment Flow:
- Create release time folder 202508211230 (date example)
- Symlink shared files into new release
- Extract new version to releases/202508211230/
- Atomically switch current symlink to new release
- Remove old releases (keep last 2-3)
  
```
/home/USER/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ current -> releases/202508211230/    # Symlink to active version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ releases/                            # All deployed versions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 202508211030/                    # Previous release
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 202508211230/                    # Current release
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/                              # Persistent data
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ var                              # Logs, tmp (symlink from active version)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pub/media/                       # Uploads, images (symlink from active version)
```
	
### Minimal Explanation:
-  current ‚Üí Symlink pointing to the active release
- releases/ ‚Üí Contains all versioned deployments
- shared/ ‚Üí Holds persistent files across deployments

This gives you zero-downtime deployments and instant rollbacks.

You can use tools that help you implement the folder-based atomic deployment structure 
(with current, releases, shared directories) on your own server.
